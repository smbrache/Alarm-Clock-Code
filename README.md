# Alarm-Clock-Code

This software was written to implement a fully functional alarm clock using an STM microcontroller for a school project in the summer of 2017. The alarm clock allowed users to set the current time and time of the alarm, snooze the alarm or turn it off completely, and played an MP3 file from a USB thumb drive when the alarm was set to go off. 

**NOTE: I did not write all of this code. Code I did not write is identified as such in main.c**

### Technical Skills

The technical skills used in the development of this software are as follows.
* Analyzed large blocks of complex and difficult to understand code to deduce functionality and for use as a reference to write my own code to dictate microcontroller behavior. For example, the ConfigureDisplay() function was written after analysis and understanding of how 
* Created a design strategy for all functions I had to write. For complex sections of code, such as clock incrementation in the main function, I designed a Finite State Machine, wrote pseudocode, and then implemented the code.
* Tested code extensively to ensure correct, deterministic, and precise behavior
